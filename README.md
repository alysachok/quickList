# [Quick List App](https://quicklist.aleksandra.lysachok.dev)

## Description
The Quick List App is an intuitive to-do list manager that enables users to easily organize their daily tasks. This app utilizes local storage to store data in JSON format directly within the user's browser, providing an immediate and persistent experience across sessions without the need for a server.

Creating this project allowed me to practice CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) data operations and manage application state on the front-end side.

## Features

- **Create**: Add new tasks to the to-do list.
- **Read**: View the list of tasks.
- **Update**: Mark tasks as completed and edit the content of existing tasks.
- **Delete**: Remove tasks from the list or delete all list

---
- **Sharing**: Share the to-do list via Email, WhatsApp, Telegram, or iMessage.
- **Export**: Download the to-do list as a PDF.
- **Responsiveness**: Adapts to various screen sizes for a seamless user experience.

## Technology Stack

- **React** 
- **Material-UI** 
- **TypeScript** 
- **html2canvas:** A JavaScript library for capturing screenshot images of web content.
- **jsPDF:** A library to generate PDF documents using JavaScript.
